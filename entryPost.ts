// GitHub Actions `post:` entry point — a bootstrap and nothing else. GHA runs

// frozen forever for SHA-pinned consumers; the cleanup logic ships in the npm
// package and floats with it. Full rationale in wiki/action-bootstrap.md.
//
// Two rules, both load-bearing. Imports stay stdlib-only: a bare specifier
// crashes the post-step with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND after the agent already
// exited 0, which is #815. And the state gate stays, so the runs that rotate
// no credential never pay an npm bootstrap to find that out —
// `STATE_oauth_writeback` is exactly what `core.getState` reads, without
// needing `@actions/core` to resolve.
