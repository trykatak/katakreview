 * `"bedrock"` means the actual model ID comes from `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID`
 * (an AWS-canonical Bedrock model ID like `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7`
 * or `amazon.nova-pro-v1:0`). `"vertex"` means the actual model ID comes
 * from `VERTEX_MODEL_ID` (a Vertex AI model ID like

 * customers self-select for version control — silent alias bumps would break
 * compliance review, model-access enrollment, and provisioned-throughput
 * contracts. so the single `bedrock/byok` and `vertex/byok` entries are
 * routing slugs, not model aliases: the harness reads the backend-specific
 * env var and routes to claude-code for Anthropic IDs or opencode for
 * everything else.
 *
 * `"azure"` is the same shape for a different reason. models.dev DOES carry an
 * Azure catalog, but the id it lists is sent to Azure as the DEPLOYMENT NAME,
 * and a deployment is named by whoever created it — so cataloging `azure/gpt-5`
 * would only work for customers who kept the portal's default name. the
 * deployment comes from `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT` instead. unlike bedrock/vertex it
 * resolves to a provider-PREFIXED specifier (`azure/<deployment>`), matching
 * openai-compatible, because `azure` is a real opencode provider id.

 *     `meta.llama4-scout-17b-instruct-v1:0`. AWS-published, lowercase, the
 *     foundation provider always appears as a discrete dot-segment.
 *   - inference-profile ARNs: `arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-2:<acct>:application-inference-profile/<user-name>`.
 *     `<user-name>` is operator-chosen, so a naive substring check is fragile
 *     in both directions (Anthropic profile named without "anthropic" → routes
 *     to opencode and misses CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK; non-Anthropic profile
 *     whose name happens to contain "anthropic" → routes to claude-code).
 *
 * we anchor on a discrete dot-segment match (case-insensitive). this catches
 * every published foundation ID and is conservative for ARN-form IDs: ARN
 * names that don't include "anthropic" as their own dot-segment route to
 * opencode by default. operators using ARN-form IDs whose backing model is
 * Anthropic should set `KATAK_AGENT=claude` to force the right route, or
 * include the foundation segment in the profile name.
