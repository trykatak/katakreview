/**
 * Codex agent — secure harness around the `codex` CLI (`codex exec --json`).
 *
 * Security model, mirroring the opencode and claude harnesses:
 * - native exec surfaces (`shell_tool`, `unified_exec`, code-mode, browser /
 *   computer use, plugins, lifecycle hooks) are turned off in `config.toml`'s
 *   `[features]` table. shell goes through the MCP `shell` tool, which runs
 *   with a filtered, secret-free env.
 * - subagent fan-out (`multi_agent*`) is off: codex exposes no pre-tool hook
 *   carrying a subagent marker, so there is no way to reproduce the
 *   mutating-MCP-tool gate the other two harnesses enforce on subagents. an
 *   ungated subagent could call `checkout_pr` / `push_branch` behind the
 *   orchestrator's back — see action/agents/subagentToolGates.ts.
 * - the sandbox stays ON (`approval_policy = "never"` rather than
 *   `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`), so the native `apply_patch`
 *   tool is confined to the workspace even if the agent ignores instructions.
 * - `CODEX_HOME` holds auth.json under KATAK_DATA_DIR, which the MCP shell's
 *   mount namespace tmpfs-overlays. NOTE codex exposes no path-deny surface of
 *   its own, so unlike claude this harness does NOT consume
 *   `ctx.secretDenyPaths` — the namespace overlay is the only layer here.
 *
 * Feature toggles never use `--enable` / `--disable`: an unrecognized name is a
 * HARD arg-parse error on those (measured: `Error: Unknown feature flag`) but an
 * ignored key in the config table, so a codex version that drops a flag would
 * otherwise brick every run at startup.
 *
 * The boundary itself is held by `writeCodexConfig` marking the checkout
 * `trust_level = "untrusted"`, which stops codex loading the repo's own
 * `.codex/config.toml` — a layer that OUTRANKS ours and could otherwise
 * re-enable the native shell from a file in the untrusted tree. The same
 * settings also ride as `-c` flags (`securityOverrideFlags`) as defence in
 * depth, since those outrank every layer and cost nothing.

/**
 * The security boundary, as `-c` overrides rather than config-file entries.
 *
 * `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` is NOT the last word. Codex ranks its config layers
 * by an explicit integer ladder (`config/src/config_layer_source.rs`): our user
 * layer is **20**, the repo's own `.codex/config.toml` is **25**, and `-c`
 * session flags are **30**. So the checkout outranks us — and
 * `sanitize_project_config`'s denylist strips only base-URL / provider / notify
 * / profile / otel keys, NOT `sandbox_mode`, `approval_policy` or `features`.
 *
 * Which means a fork PR shipping a `.codex/config.toml` could re-enable
 * `shell_tool` and hand itself a native shell with the full run env — the exact
 * boundary this harness exists to hold, defeated by a file in the untrusted
 * tree. Measured at 0.147.0: with `model` set in both layers the REPO's value
 * won; with the same key passed as `-c`, ours won.
 *
 * These keys therefore ride at precedence 30 on every invocation, `exec` and
 * `exec resume` alike — belt to the braces of the untrusted checkout, which is
 * what actually stops the repo layer loading.
 *
 * SINCE `writeCodexConfig` MARKS THE CHECKOUT UNTRUSTED, the project layer no
 * longer loads at all, and these flags are defence in depth rather than the
 * boundary itself — they survive a change in trust semantics, and cost nothing.
 * The notes below describe why enumeration alone was never going to be enough,
 * which is what motivated finding the structural fix.
 *
 * THIS PIN IS NOT COMPLETE, and the shape of the gap matters more than the
 * length of the list. `RawMcpServerConfig` alone carries ~26 fields and none is
 * in the denylist, so enumerating keys can only ever chase the exploitable
 * ones. What is pinned is what was measured to ESCALATE — take over the
 * sandbox, widen its extent, redirect our server, or silently remove it. The
 * residue is denial-of-service on the repo's own run (`enabled_tools`,
 * per-tool approval), which costs that repo its own agent and gains it nothing.
 *
 * THE ENTRY IS WRITTEN EXPLICITLY rather than omitted, and the reason is not
 * the one an earlier version of this comment gave. Absent and `untrusted` are
 * equivalent for layer ADMISSION — `is_trusted()` is `matches!(.., Some(Trusted))`
 * and `disabled_reason_for_decision` returns a reason for every other value, so
 * a missing entry disables the layer just as well. What omitting it loses is
 * INHERITANCE: `decision_for_dir` falls back from the cwd keys to the project
 * root and then the repo root, so a grant on an ancestor would decide for us.
 * Our exact-cwd key is consulted first and settles it.
 *
 * Verify with the probe in wiki/codex-agent.md on every codex bump — a layer
 * ladder is exactly the kind of thing a major version reorders.

 * `writeCodexConfig` marks the checkout untrusted and codex therefore never
 * loads that file itself. It was not written for that reason: codex DID load
 * it, and this existed only to fix approval — those servers keep codex's
 * PROMPTING default, and `codex exec` has nobody to answer, so every call to a
 * repo-provided tool came back `user cancelled MCP tool call`. The trust fix
 * later disabled the layer wholesale and quietly promoted this function from an
 * ergonomic fix to the feature itself. The other two
 * harnesses merge repo MCP config without adding a second confirmation, and a
 * prompt in a non-interactive run isn't a security boundary, it's a guaranteed
 * failure — the boundary is which servers the repo owner configured.
 *
 * THAT BOUNDARY RESTS ENTIRELY ON WHEN THIS RUNS, so do not move the call.
 * A copied `[mcp_servers.x]` is unsandboxed native code execution holding named
 * run credentials: codex connects every enabled server eagerly at session
 * startup (`connection_manager.rs` filters on `enabled()` and spawns, nothing
 * waits for the model), the spawn is a plain `Command::new` with NO sandbox
 * wrapper of any kind (`stdio_server_launcher.rs`), and `create_env_for_mcp_server`
 * resolves each name in `env_vars` straight out of OUR process env.
 * What keeps that the repo OWNER's choice and not a fork author's is that the
 * read happens before the agent's first turn: runs are dispatched at
 * `ref: defaultBranch` (`utils/github/triggerWorkflow.ts`) and `writeCodexConfig`
 * is called once at harness start, so the tree here is always the default
 * branch. Fork content arrives later, via `checkout_pr`, and is never re-read —
 * codex cannot load it itself either, because the checkout is untrusted.
 * Re-reading this file after a checkout, or rewriting the config per turn,
 * turns a fork PR into arbitrary code execution with our credentials.
 *
 * The approval mode has to travel WITH a transport: an `[mcp_servers.<name>]`
 * table carrying only `default_tools_approval_mode` fails bootstrap outright
 * (`invalid transport in mcp_servers.<name>`), and a `-c` dotted override fails
 * the same way, because each config layer is validated on its own before the
 * layers merge. Copying the section verbatim into our layer is what works — the
 * duplicate definitions merge, transport and all.
 *
 * Sections are copied by line rather than parsed: the transport shape varies
 * (`command`/`args`/`env`, `url`/`bearer_token_env_var`, sub-tables) and none of
 * it needs interpreting. Our key goes immediately after the server's own header
 * so a following sub-table can't capture it, and is skipped entirely when the
 * repo already set one — TOML forbids a duplicate key in a table, and a repo
 * that made an explicit choice should keep it.

 *
 * This table exists because codex is the one harness that cannot report its own
 * cost: claude-code gets `total_cost_usd` from Anthropic and opencode prices each
 * part itself, but the Codex SDK's `Usage` carries TOKENS ONLY and no cost field.
 * Without it every codex run persists a null `costUsd` and contributes $0 to
 * every spend surface (`runAnalytics` simply sums the column).
 *
 * A model absent here yields `undefined`, never 0 — an unknown price must not
 * read as free, which would silently understate real spend.
 *
 * These are LIST prices, and two caveats ride with them. A run on a ChatGPT
 * subscription (`CODEX_AUTH_JSON`) spends no per-token money at all, so its
 * figure is what the run WOULD have cost on the API — consistent with
 * `WorkflowRun.costUsd` being modelled rather than invoiced. And these are the
 * base tier: OpenAI bills roughly double above a 200k context, so a
 * long-context turn is under-counted here.
