/**
 * Detect agent-runtime auth failures that should be reformatted as an actionable
 * key-fix CTA before being shown to the user. Covers the shapes we see:
 *   - missing key (validateAgentApiKey throw): contains MISSING_KEY_MARKER
 *   - revoked / invalid key (Claude CLI 401 surfaced via api_error_status):
 *     "Invalid API key · Fix external API key" + similar provider variants
 *   - direct-Anthropic 401 (`Failed to authenticate. API Error: 401 ...
 *     {"type":"error","error":{"type":"authentication_error", ...
 *     "Invalid bearer token"}}`) emitted by the Claude CLI for revoked /
 *     mistyped / rotated `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. see #782.
 *   - expired credentials (#931): Bedrock 403 `Failed to authenticate. API
 *     Error: 403 {"Message":"*** has expired"}` (short-lived bearer tokens),
 *     OpenAI OAuth "Your authentication token has expired", and Codex
 *     "Token refresh failed: 401". the Bedrock pattern is anchored to the
 *     Claude CLI emission ("Failed to authenticate. API Error:") so generic
 *     auth chatter in agent stderr can't misclassify a hang as a key error.
 *   - DeepSeek invalid key (#960): `Authentication Fails, Your api key:
 *     ****XXXX is invalid`. anchored to "Your api key: ... is invalid" so it
 *     can't collide with DeepSeek's already-handled `Insufficient balance`
 *     billing shape (which routes to formatProviderBillingExhausted).
 *   - org-disabled Claude subscription (#1072): `Your organization has
 *     disabled Claude subscription access for Claude Code`, an entitlement
 *     denial with its own remedy — see isClaudeSubscriptionDisabledError.
 *   - OpenAI rejected key: `Incorrect API key provided: sk-proj-***`, OpenAI's
 *     own wording for a revoked, rotated or wrong-project key. Absent from this
 *     list every such run rendered the generic one-line "Run failed." with no
 *     cause at all — measured on two accounts sitting at 100% failure, one of
 *     them for a week. Matched on the full phrase rather than "Incorrect API
 *     key" alone for the reason the markers above are phrased distinctively:
 *     this predicate short-circuits the whole rendering pipeline on a substring
 *     of arbitrary agent output.
