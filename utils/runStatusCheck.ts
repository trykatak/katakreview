/**
 * Single source of truth for the `pullfrog` commit-status check-run — the row a PR's
 * checks list shows while a run is in flight and after it ends.
 *
 * Pullfrog dispatches its workflow with `ref: <default branch>`, so the GitHub Actions
 * run attaches its check suite to the default branch head and never to the PR head.
 * Nothing about a run is therefore visible from the PR itself unless we post this
 * check-run against the PR head sha ourselves.
 *
 * Created `in_progress` by the server at dispatch — before the runner boots, and
 * upstream of every action-side failure that would otherwise leave the PR silent
 * (billing 402, token resolution, bad model slug, missing provider key). Moved to a
 * terminal conclusion by whichever of three actors reaches it first, all calling
 * `finalizeRunStatusCheck`:
 *
 *   1. the action at run end (`reportStatusChecks`)
 *   2. the `workflow_run.completed` webhook (covers cancel / SIGKILL / early throw)
 *   3. the hourly stuck-run reaper (covers a dropped webhook)
 *
 * That three-layer close-out is what makes an `in_progress` check safe here: a check
 * stranded `in_progress` on a required branch-protection rule would block merges
 * forever, which is why this file did not exist before.
