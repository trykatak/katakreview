// Codex-to-OpenCode auth bridging for the action runtime.
//
// `pullfrog auth codex` stores a Codex CLI `auth.json` blob in the Pullfrog
// per-org secret store (production Postgres) — NOT a GitHub Actions secret.
// This is non-negotiable: the OAuth refresh chain rotates on every use, and
// `entryPost.ts` writes the rotated chain back via `PUT /api/runtime/secret`
// after each run. GH Actions secrets are immutable at runtime, so a token
// stashed there silently expires on the first refresh (~1h). See
// wiki/codex-auth.md for the full constraint.
//
// At runtime, `CODEX_AUTH_JSON` lands in process.env via `runContext.dbSecrets`
// merged in main.ts — sourced from Pullfrog Postgres through the OIDC-validated
// run-context endpoint, never from `${{ secrets.CODEX_AUTH_JSON }}` in
// workflow yaml.
//
// The run-context endpoint calls `maybeRotateCodexSecret` (see
// `utils/codexSecretRotation.ts`) inside a Postgres row lock just before
// decrypting + returning dbSecrets. That serializes concurrent rotations
// across the fleet: the first concurrent run rotates the token; the rest
// see the just-written value and skip. Result: the token in
// `process.env.CODEX_AUTH_JSON` is guaranteed fresh for at least the
// rotation safety margin (~50min) when this code runs. No action-side
// pre-flight refresh is needed.
//
// This utility then:
//   1. parses + validates the env value
//   2. decodes the access_token JWT's `exp` claim so opencode knows how
//      long to trust the token before its CodexAuthPlugin attempts its
//      own mid-run refresh
//   3. converts Codex's shape `{ auth_mode, tokens: { access_token,
//      refresh_token, id_token?, account_id? } }` into OpenCode's shape
//      `{ openai: { type: "oauth", refresh, access, expires, accountId } }`
//   4. materializes it to disk under a path the MCP-shell mount-namespace
//      sandbox can hide from bash: `/var/lib/pullfrog/opencode/auth.json` in
//      CI (sudo-bootstrapped, fail-closed if sudo unavailable),
//      `$HOME/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` locally (sandbox is no-op
//      locally so the path is irrelevant to security)
//   5. returns the path + the original refresh token so the post-run hook
//      can detect a mid-run rotation and write back to Pullfrog
//
// Why `/var/lib/pullfrog/` and not `$HOME` in CI: bash via MCP runs inside a
// mount namespace that overlays tmpfs on `/var/lib/pullfrog/` (see FS_MOUNTS
// in action/mcp/shell.ts), so bash sees an empty dir while opencode's
// internal auth module — which runs in the agent process outside that
// namespace — reads/writes the real file. `$HOME` can't be tmpfs-overlaid
// without breaking the agent's legitimate need to access ~/.npm, ~/.cache,
// etc.
//
// See [wiki/codex-auth.md] for the full data-flow picture.
