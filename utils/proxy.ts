/**
 * Mint an OpenRouter proxy key via `/api/proxy-token` and inject it as
 * `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for runs that route through Pullfrog Router (managed
 * billing accounts) or OSS-grant paths.
 *
 * Authenticates one of two ways:
 *   - production: GitHub Actions OIDC token minted from the stashed
 *     credentials via `fetchIdTokenFromStash` (env-free)
 *   - local dev (`API_URL` is localhost): `x-dev-repo` header bypass
 *
 * `runProxyResolution` is the entrypoint `main.ts` calls. It wraps
 * `resolveProxyModel` and renders the user-facing copy itself (job summary
 * + PR progress comment) before rethrowing the structured error — handled
 * here, not in the outer `main()` catch, because `toolContext` doesn't
 * exist yet at this point in the pipeline.
 *
 *   - 402 → `BillingError` (card declined, balance empty, 3DS, etc.)
 *   - 5xx → `TransientError` (the mint is down — retried in-run first)
 *   - 404 → `TransientError` (stale repo↔account link — re-homes on next webhook)
