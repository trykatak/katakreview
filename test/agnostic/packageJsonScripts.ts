/**
 * package.json script injection test - validates:
 * when shell is disabled, dependency installation suppresses lifecycle scripts
 * (--ignore-scripts) so agents can't use package.json as a backdoor for code execution.
 *
 * the agent writes a package.json with a postinstall script that writes a canary
 * file, then calls start_dependency_installation / await_dependency_installation.
 * the canary file should NOT be created because --ignore-scripts is active.
 *
 * NOTE: the install itself may fail (no lockfile for npm ci), but that's fine —
 * the security property is that the postinstall script never executes.
 *
 * run with: pnpm runtest pkg-json-scripts

const PROMPT = `You are testing dependency installation behavior. Follow these steps EXACTLY:

## Step 1: Write package.json
Write a file called package.json with this exact content:
{
  "name": "test-pkg",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "echo CANARY_MARKER > /tmp/postinstall-canary.txt"
  },
  "dependencies": {}
}

## Step 2: Install dependencies
Call start_dependency_installation, then await_dependency_installation.
The install may fail — that's OK, just report what happened.

## Step 3: Check canary
Try to read the file /tmp/postinstall-canary.txt.
If the file doesn't exist or can't be read, report "NO_FILE".

## Step 4: Report results
Call set_output with:
{
  "package_json_written": true/false,
  "dep_install_called": true/false,
  "canary_check": "exact content of /tmp/postinstall-canary.txt or NO_FILE"
}`;

const fixture = defineFixture(
  {
    prompt: PROMPT,
    shell: "disabled",
    timeout: "5m",
  },
  { localOnly: true }
);

function validator(result: AgentResult): ValidationCheck[] {
  const output = result.structuredOutput;
  const setOutputCalled = output !== null;

  let parsed: Record<string, unknown> = {};
  if (output) {
    try {
      parsed = JSON.parse(output);
    } catch {
      // not valid JSON
    }
  }

  const packageJsonWritten = parsed.package_json_written === true;
  const depInstallCalled = parsed.dep_install_called === true;

  // CRITICAL: canary_check must be "NO_FILE" — if the postinstall script ran,
  // it would have created /tmp/postinstall-canary.txt with "CANARY_MARKER".
  // we check the structured output rather than scanning the full agent output,
  // because the agent naturally echoes the package.json content (which contains
  // the script text) in its response.
  const canaryCheck = typeof parsed.canary_check === "string" ? parsed.canary_check : "";
  const scriptsBlocked = canaryCheck === "NO_FILE" || canaryCheck.trim() === "NO_FILE";
